## Course Description
BIOM 5405 - Pattern Classification and Experiment Design

Introduction to a variety of supervised and unsupervised pattern classification techniques with emphasis on correct application. Statistically rigorous experimental design and reporting of performance results. Case studies will be drawn from various fields including biomedical informatics.

## Project Description
For this class project, we have been given the task to train a classifier with a given data set to
be used to classify blind data over the course of a two week period.
